If you don't like it at all, you can disable line annotations\n     in GitGutter.sublime-settings:\n  \n         \"show_line_annotation\": false\n  \n     or in Preferences.sublime-settings:\n  \n         \"git_gutter_show_line_annotation\": false\n  \n     The line annotation is displayed if word wrap is disabled by default due to some\n     rendering issues caused by the underlying phantom text.\n  \n     The blame message is also displayed in the status bar by default.\n  \n     Both the status bar text and the line annotations can be customized via jinja2\n     templates. GitGutter therefore provides a couple more variables.\n  \n     For a more detailed description of the settings, please refer to the documentation.\n  \n       http://jisaacks.github.io/GitGutter/settings/#line-annotation\n  \n    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n     C H A N G E L O G\n  \n    README:\n     - Move Documentation to GitHub Pages\n  \n    Fix:\n     - Skip evaluation if rebase is active (Issue #508)\n     - Increase timeout for git version (#510)\n  \n    Feature:\n     - Display git blame message of active line (#487)\n  \n    Enhancement:\n     - Print more debugging info\n     - Add support for diff --ignore-cr-at-eol (requires git 2.18+)\n\n  1.8.0:\n  ======\n  \n     A N N O U N C E M E N T\n  \n     This pre-release adds enables usage of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n  \n     To enable WSL just setup a unix-like path in the \"git_binary\" setting.\n  \n         \"git_binary\": \"/usr/bin/git\"\n  \n     Known Issues:\n      1.
